### TODOs
The matching functions for the buy and sell orders are more or less copy paste of each other. This really needs to be
refactored to remove the duplicate code!

Add more documentation in the code + high level design document explaining the key design decisions and potential
improvements (e.g. using off heap memory for the processing engine for performance)
